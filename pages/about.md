I appreciate your interest in learning more about my background. ✋

I'm a computer technician by vocation, born and raised on the Adriatic coast of Croatia, with more than a decade of professional experience in digital design. I've been involved in a diverse range of projects during my career, covering fields such as eHealth, telematics, data, web3, IoT, digital marketing etc. I've gained valuable insights into numerous product development cycles, as well as user and business goals, and learned how to give and solicit feedback without being overly attached to my work when constructive feedback is put forward.

I consider myself detail-oriented, pragmatic and collaborative. Over the years, I've held both project-based and full-time roles in various distributed and async teams, always striving for diligence and discipline in remote work. With professional proficiency in verbal and written English, I'm able to hold fluent conversations and communicate ideas and pitches efficiently and succinctly.

Beyond working, I enjoy a game of basketball, my bike, Fujifilm camera and tinkering with embedded electronics, when family time allows.
